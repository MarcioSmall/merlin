# Calculator Project with Python and Django

## What I will try to create :

Calculator in RPN , with stacks , OOP

Variables , Strings and Expressions

Internal functions in RPN for calculator and manipulation of strings 

Interpreter of the calculator with "WHILE" , "IF" , functions , variables and expressions

The interpreter will have a name of MERLIN 

Unfortunatelly the CODE of the CALCULATOR and MERLIN interpreter will be in PORTUGUESE

I am from Brazil and I am living now in Portugal 

Today is March, 24th 2023 ... For more then 20 years I have programmed in C++ ...

In January this year, I was 10 years without programming ... 

Learning PYTHON, Django, SQL in less than 3 months, but I have learned a lot

The Code in Python , I tried to let the code very easy to migrate to C++, Java or any language

That's why I do not use as many Python's resources as I would like to use

Follow me and give your ideas 




# Wow , I need a job !!!
